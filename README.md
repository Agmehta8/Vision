Vision – End-of-Life Guidance App

Vision is a gentle digital guide for patients and families navigating serious illness.

It is designed to feel calm, non-urgent, and supportive — more like a conversation than a form.

The product prioritizes emotional safety, consent, and pacing over efficiency or data collection.

This repository contains a progressive web app prototype focused on early design and interaction.
